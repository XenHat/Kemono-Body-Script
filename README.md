Aftermarket replacement for Utilizator's Kemono Body in Second Life

**What is is?**

This is a from-scratch, compatible and open-source implementation of the body script used in the Utilizator Kemono body (and other mods for it)

**WARNING**

Use of this script/product is only licensed for legal owners of the [UTILIZATOR Kemono body](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/UTILIZATOR-Kemono/6070005).
If you did not purchase the **Kemono body**, this script isn't for you.

I do not condone or endorse the use of this script in any other way, nor will I provide any kind of help/service if you do not own the **Kemono Body**.

Proof of ownership will be asked and required if you request services about this product.

**Why?**

  - I was not satisfied with the stock script included in the Kemono body.
  - At the time (June 2017), it was impossible to combine the Starbright Fitted Kemono Torso and the Utilizator Kemono body into a single linkset.
  - To prove (myself and others) that I could do it.
  - I am easily bored and I can't sit still doing nothing.
  
  **Current Status**
  
  The best way to keep track is to look at the Projects tab.
 
  **The Future**
  
  I plan to include support for the following:
  
  - `Rei's Stuff Chest`
  - `[BB/MM] Thunder Thighs`
  - `Starbright Adult bits`
  
  Support for the following body parts is under evaluation:
  
  - `[BB/MM] Booty Butt`
  - `[BB/MM] Kemono Boobies`
  - `::AMBIX:: Teeny Tatas`
  - `*R* Kemono Male Chest`
  
  How these different body parts will be supported is still TBD.

Support for the kApp skin applier is planned, but closed source requirements prevents this feature from ever touching this repository. An in-world vendor will exist for this feature and similar proprietary conveniences.
