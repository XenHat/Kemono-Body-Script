#### Current Status
  
  The best way to keep track of this product is to [look at the Projects tab](https://github.com/XenHat/Kemono-Body-Script/projects/5). Features marked as "Done" are currently implemented.
 
#### The Future
  
  I plan to include support for the following:
  
  - `Rei's Stuff Chest`
  - `[BB/MM] Thunder Thighs`
  - `Starbright Adult bits`
  
  Support for the following body parts is under evaluation:
  
  - `[BB/MM] Booty Butt`
  - `[BB/MM] Kemono Boobies`
  - `::AMBIX:: Teeny Tatas`
  - `*R* Kemono Male Chest`
  
  How these different body parts will be supported is still TBD.

## FAQ

### Why re-script the Kemono body?

  - I was not satisfied with the stock script included in the Kemono body.
  - When I started writing this script (June 2017), it was impossible to combine the Starbright Fitted Kemono Torso and the Utilizator Kemono body into a single linkset. There were other issues and me and a colleague have been debating re-writing it for a year prior but that was the deciding factor.
  - To prove (myself and others) that I was smart enough to succeed.
  - Boredom, and developing my ability to focus on a project for more than a week.
  
### Why open-source?

*Science isn't about "Why?", it's about "Why not?!"* - Cave Johnson

More seriously, because I like Open-Source. I realize this is probably a terrible idea and I am probably angering a few people by doing this. I don't really care that much. The UTILIZATOR Kemono and the Starbright Fitted Kemono Torso are good products, you should buy them. I'm only making my personal rescript available to a wider audience in case it helps someone else.

### Are you rich? Why are you not selling this? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY?!?!

Ahaha, no, I'm rather poor, actually. I do plan to profit from this product, mostly in the form of precompiled scripts, support, personalized modifications, and a closed-source version with an in-world updater and (in-house) applier support.
