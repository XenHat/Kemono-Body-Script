Aftermarket replacement for Utilizator's Kemono Body in Second Life

**What is is?**

This is a from-scratch, compatible and open-source implementation of the body script used in the Utilizator Kemono body (and other mods for it)

**Why?**

  - I was not satisfied with the stock script included in the Kemono body
  - At the time (June 2017), it was impossible to combine the Starbright Fitted Kemono Torso and the Utilizator Kemono body into a single linkset.
  - Some people said I shouldn't bother because I could never achieve something better than the stock script
  - I am easily bored and I can't sit still doing nothing
  
  **Current Status**
  
  The current factory features are implemented:
  
  - Stock kemono blades alpha toggle
  - Genitals and Nipples PG state
  - Fitted Torso Nipple states
  - Fitted Torso genitals states
  - Fitted Torso Butt States
  - Fitted Torso API commands
  
  The current stock features need to be implemented:
  
  - Fitted Torso Nipple Alpha states
  
  **The Future**
  
  I plan to include support for the following parts:
  
  - `Rei's Stuff Chest`
  - `[BB/MM] Thunder Thighs`
  
  Support for the following body parts is under evaluation:
  
  - `[BB/MM] Booty Butt`
  - `[BB/MM] Kemono Boobies`
  - `::AMBIX:: Teeny Tatas`
  - `*R* Kemono Male Chest`
  
  How these different body parts will be supported is still TBD.
